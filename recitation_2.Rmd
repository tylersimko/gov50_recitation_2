```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# normally in a .Rmd file, you'll load packages in this first chunk

library(PPBDS.data)
library(tidyverse)

```

I have played a sneaky trick. By placing this template file on GitHub, we accomplished three goals at once:

1. You practiced cloning a repository from GitHub! 
2. You now know the agenda for today's recitation.
3. You now have a handy place to take notes and practice code for today. 

A fourth, smaller, goal is that you can see some cool formatting tricks in RMarkdown (like the numbered list above). You can find a bunch more by looking at this [list of cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

## Census Maps

A very common data source for many of you will be the US Census. You can get a ton of demographic information at multiple levels, from the state to the neighborhood level. We're going to walk through [a few sections of the textbook together](https://davidkane9.github.io/PPBDS/maps.html). 

## Spot the bugs!

Error messages are scary but - believe it or not - someone was trying to help you when they wrote it. Most of the time, if you carefully read the error message, you can figure out a rough idea of where your bug is. This is especially true once you start to recognize common patterns in bugs. 

These were very common mistakes from Tutorial 2. Let's find the bugs together:

## Some Practice

Here are some topics that students asked to cover in Recitation:

#### 1. joins (full, inner, left, right, etc.)
- bind vs. join

#### 2. plot themes

#### 3. if_else
- write code from the inside out. you can write your if_else statement first! within the if_else, you can write your condition first! no need to write everything at once.

#### 4. pivots
- wider vs. longer
- names_to vs. names_from
- values_to vs. values_from

#### 5. str_detect

str_detect helps you find patterns in strings. This can be helpful if the thing you want to check for is more complicated than just strict equality (which we test with "==".)

Notice in diamonds that the cut column has values including "Good" and "Very Good."

There is an entire language called "Regular Expressions" which can make these string searches as complicated as you want. For example, return True for any string that has a two digit number anywhere inside of it. There's no need to learn all of them now, but it's helpful to keep in mind as a tool that you might need for your project. 

#### 6. Objects
- character exercise 8
- lists exercise 5
